There's a bug in the game that when you let go of the keys the snake will start moving faster and faster that it looks like its freezing or something
when i followed the tutorial it didn't happen to him on the Windows machine he was using so it either because of my Linux machine 
or because of a mistake i made in the code, specifically in the move fucntion.
I would suggest either tweaking the values of the move function or trying a different approach to make the snake move or
just try it out on windows and see if the bug remains or not.
